The recommended way to start a project is with the [official boilerplate](https://github.com/aklinker1/a1-boilerplate). It includes build scripts, restart on save, an E2E testing script, a suggested file structure, and much more.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aklinker1/a1-boilerplate.git <project-name>
```

TODO: Fill in more info about boilerplate usage.
